## Tetrominoes v2


I watched the movie "tetris" and I thought that a tetris game where the UI is entirely in the terminal looked really endearing. I tried to make something similar in an earlier project, but due to a lack of planning ahead, I ended up making a lot of decisions that I would end up regretting down the line until I thought that the best choice was to start again with those mistakes in mind.


In this second attempt, I will make a plan and make requierments so that I can have a clearer idea of what I need to do.

# Requierments

1. The games user interface will be exclusively done through the terminal.
2. it will have almost (if not) all the same functionalities as a regular game of tetris
    that being:
        it will have all 7 different tetrominoes
            O-Tetromino
            L-Tetromino
            J-Tetromino
            Z-Tetromino
            I-Tetromino
            S-Tetromino
            T-Tetromino
        the tetrominoes will be rotateable
        you can save a tetromino to be used later
        you can see the next 3 tetrominoes that are to come

3. The user interface will use square brackets and dots in the place of blocks and empty spaces
    a game should look like this
